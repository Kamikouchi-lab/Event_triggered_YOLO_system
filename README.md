### Abstract
Manipulation of neural activity is necessary for identifying the neural basis of animal behavior. Optogenetic methods allow time-specific manipulation of neural activity in animals with high precision. Devices have been proposed for optogenetics experiments that automatically detect animal behavior and trigger photostimulations, but it is difficult for biologists to implement these devices in an experimental system because of the complicated system and programming. In this study, we establish an event-triggered feedback system for optogenetic manipulation of neural activity that is introduced in the experimental system easily and highly applicable. Using fly copulation as an example, we evaluated the models for fly copulation detections and succeeded in detecting copulation initiation with high accuracy.
